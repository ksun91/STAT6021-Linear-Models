2.	Construct the analysis-of-variance table and test for significance of regression.
3.	Calculate t statistics for testing the hypotheses H0: β2 = 0 H0: β7 = 0, and H0: β8 = 0. What conclusions can you draw about the roles the variables x2, x7, and x8 play in the model?
4.	Calculate R2 and R2Adj for this model.
5.	Using the partial F test, determine the contribution of x7 to the model. How is this partial F statistic related to the t test for β7 calculated in part c above?

2.	Calculate R2 and R2Adj. How do these quantities compare to the values computed for the model in Problem 3.1, which included an additional regressor (x2)?
3.	Calculate a 95% CI on β7. Also find a 95% CI on the mean number of games won by a team when x7 = 56.0 and x8 = 2100. Compare the lengths of these CIs to the lengths of the corresponding CIs from Problem 3.3.
4.	What conclusions can you draw from this problem about the consequences of omitting an important regressor from a model?

3.5 Consider the gasoline mileage data in Table B.3.
1.	Fit a multiple linear regression model relatmg gasoline mileage y(miles per gallon) to engine displacement x1 and the number of carburetor barrels x6.
2.	Construct the analysis-of-variance table and test for significance of regression.
3.	Calculate R2 and R2Adj for this model. Compare this to the R2 and the R2Adj for the simple linear regression model relating mileage to engine displacement in Problem 2.4.

7.	Find a 95% prediction interval for a new observation on gasoline mileage when x1 = 257 in.3 and x6 = 2 barrels.

3.6 In Problem 2.4 you were asked to compute a 95% CI on mean gasoline prediction interval on mileage when the engine displacement x1 = 275 in.3 Compare the lengths of these intervals to the lengths of the confidence and prediction intervals from Problem 3.5 above. Does this tell you anything about the benefits of adding x6 to the model?

3.8 The data in Table B.5 present the performance of a chemical process as a function of sever controllable process variables.

2.	Test for significance of regression. Calculate R2 and R2Adj.
3.	Using t tests determine the contribution of x6 and x7 to the model.
4.	Construct 95% CIs on β6 and β7.
5.	Refitthe model using only x6 as the regressor. Test for significance of regression and calculate R2 and R2Adj. Discuss your findings. Based on these statistics, are you satisfied with this model?
6.	Construct a 95% CI on β6 using the model you fit in part e. Compare the length of this CI to the length of the CI in part d. Does this tell you anything important about the contribution of x7 to the model?
7.	Compare the values of MSRes obtained for the two models you have fit (parts a and e). How did the MSRes change when you removed x7 from the model? Does this tell you anything importaut about the contributiou of x7 to the model?

3.11 An engineer performed an experiment to determine the effect of CO2 pressure, CO2 temperature, peanut moisture, CO2 flow rate, and peanut particle size on the total yield of oil per batch of peanuts. Table B.7 summarizes the experimental results.
1.	Fit a multiple linear regression model relating yield to these regressors.
2.	Test for significance of regression. What conclusions can you draw?
3.	Use t tests to assess the contribution of each regressor to the model. Discuss your findings
4.	Calculate R2 and R2Adj for this model. Compare these values to the R2and R2Adj for the multiple linear regression model relating yield to temperature and particle size. Discuss your results.
5.	Find a 95% CI for the regression coefficient for temperature for both models in part d. Discuss any differences.

3.16 Rossman [1994] presents an interesting study of average life expectancy of 40 countries. Table B.16 gives the data. The study has three responses: LifeExp is the overall average life expectancy. LifeExpMale is the average life expectancy for males, and LifeExpFemale is the average life expectancy for females. The regressors are People-per-TV, which is the average number of people per television, and People-per-Dr, which is the average number of people per physician.
1.	Fit different multiple linear regression models for each response.
2.	Test each model for significance of regression. What conclusions can you draw?
3.	Use t tests to assess the contribution of each regressor to each model. Discuss your findings.
4.	Calculate R2 and R2Adj for each model.
5.	Find a 95% CI for the regression coefficient for People-per-Dr in each model.

3.22 Show that an equivalent way to perform the test for significance of regression in multiple linear regression is to base the test on R2 as follows: To test H0: β1 = β2 = … = βk versus H1: at least one βj ≠ 0, calculate
 

and to reject H0 if the computed value of F0 exceeds Fα,k,n−p, where p = k+ 1
3.23 Suppose that a linear regression model with k = 2 regressors has been fit to n = 25 observations and R2 = 0.90.
1.	Test for significance of regression at α = 0.05. Use the results of the previous problem.
2.	What is the smallest value of R2 that would lead to the conclusion of a significant regression if α = 0.05? Are you surprised at how small this value of R2 is?

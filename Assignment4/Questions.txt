1.	Plot a scatter diagram. Does it seem likely that a straight-line model will be adequate?
2.	Fit the straight-line model. Compute the summary statistics and the residual plots. What are your conclusions regarding model adequacy?
3.	From physical chemistry the Clausius-Clapeyron equation states that
 
Repeat part b using the appropriate transformation based on this information.

5.5 A glass bottle manufacturing company has recorded data on the average number of defects per 10,000 bottles due to stones (small pieces of rock embedded in the bottle wall) and the number of weeks since the last furnace overhaul. The data are shown below.
 
1.	Fit a straight-line regression model to the data and perform the standard tests for model adequacy.
2.	Suggest an appropriate transformation to eliminate the problems encountered in part a. Fit the transformed model and check for adequacy.

5.7 Consider the methanol oxidation data in Table B.20. Perform a thorough analysis of these data. Recall the thorough residual analysis of these data from Exercise 4.29. Would a transformation improve this analysis? Why or why not? If yes, perform the transformation and repeat the full analysis.

5.9 Consider the clathrate formation data in Table B.8.
1.	Perform a thorough residual analysis of these data.
2.	b. Identify the most appropriate transformation for these data. Fit this model and repeat the residual analysis.

5.10 Consider the pressure drop data in Table B.9.
1.	Perform a thorough residual analysis of these data.
2.	Identify the most appropriate transformation for these data. Fit this model and repeat the residual analysis.

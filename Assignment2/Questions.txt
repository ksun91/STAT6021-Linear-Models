2.20 Consider the fuel consumption data given in Table B.18. The automotive engineer believes that the initial boiling point of the fuel controls the fuel consumption. Perform a thorough analysis of these data. Do the data support the engineer's belief?

2.21 Consider the wine quality of young red wines data in Table B.19. The wine-makers believe that the sulfur content has a negative impact on the taste (thus, the overall quality) of the wine. Perform a thorough analysis of these data. Do the data support the winemakers'belief?

2.22 Consider the methanol oxidation data in Table B.20. The chemist believes that ratio of inlet oxygen to the inlet methanol controls the conversion process. Perform a through analysis of these data. Do the data support the chemist's belief?

2.30 Consider the data in Problem 2.12 and assume that steam usage and average temperature are jointly normally distributed.
1.	Find the correlation between steam usage and monthly average ambient temperature.
2.	Test the hypothesis that ρ = 0.
3.	Test the hypothesis that ρ = 0.5.
4.	Find a 99% CI for ρ.
5.	
2.31 Prove that the maximum value of R2 is less than 1 if the data contain repeated (different) observations on y at the same value of x.

2.32 Consider the simple linear regression model
